#Overview

The school board has notified the head administration as Thomas High about Academic Dishonesty; specifically reading and math scores for ninth graders. Maria asked us to replace the scores with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Then, we will continue to analyze the data to describe how our changes affected the data and overall analysis.

#Results 

- The district summary code we were given showed:

(had issues screenshotting adjusted results): There were not large changes between the district summary before and after adjustment. The total student count decreased by a few hundred, the percentages for the scores decreased by tenths, however, the total budget stayed the same. 

-The school summary:

(had issues screenshotting adjusted results): Again, the changes made to the dataset did not affect the scores in a way that the school board should be concerned. 

-Seeing as it was such a small percentage taken out, it did not make a significant impact on the performance of Thomas High relative to the other schools.

-Replacing ninth-grade scores affect the following: 
  -Math/Reading by grade - When replacing the grades for 9th grades, only the 9th graders are affected - all others grades are not impacted by the     changes. 
  -Scores by school spending - I don't believe altering the dataset for 9th grades impacted school spending
  -Scores by school size - I don't believe altering the dataset for 9th grades impacted the scores by school size because we only took out a very small portion of the school
  -Scores by school type - I don't believe altering the dataset for 9th grades changed anything in regards to school type
  
#Summary

After updating the math and reading scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School, I did not see any major changes or any significant impacts to the dataset. Yes, we altered the dataset, but the group we were dealing with was not large enough for us to have noted anything down for the school board. If we do have cases of academic dishonesty, it might not be as frequent/consistent so for the future, we should look more into private testing (students testing certain feet away from others so they can't see answers), or other techniques to prevent any kind of academic dishonesty.
